# CommandingDiscord
A command manager for my bots

I found myself using the same code over and over so I abstracted it out to this package. I doubt it's really that good.
This package doesn't strive to be for everyone and while change requests and commits will be considered I would not garuntee anything. 

Feel free to use it if you want but it could probably be a million times better re-written by someone else.
